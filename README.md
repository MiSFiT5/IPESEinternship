The internship project in EPFL IPESE lab

Author: Heyuan Liu M2 MSc&T AiViC student

Title: Identify optimal configuration with a machine learning method in multi-criteria decision analysis

## Shape Algorithms for Typical Solution Identifications

In the Folder of 16000Experiment, There are several Python files which are components of the Typical Solution Selectors. 

Including functions for
  - ISS 
  - Mesh Saliency
  - Harris Corner Detector in 3D

And you could find the visualization functions in Visualization.ipynb, which is a Jupyter Notebook for a better visualizations in data sicence.

Before You get started, please make sure about that you have the Python environment on your computer. This part is developed under Python 3.7.8, and no clear differences with higher edition of the Python.

### Install necessary packages 
Go to the Folder 16000Experiment and run the following command with Terminal

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Give it a GO
With the Environment established, 

RUN 
```bash
python main.py
```
in Ternimal
